# IBM One AI, PowerAI, ML/DL, IBM Cloud Private Presentations & Demos!

Just sharing a few things about **Cloud Computing**, **Machine Learning** and our **PowerAI & WML solutions for private AI Cloud**, **Application Modernization**, **IBM i** & **DevOps** . 

All based on the awesome projects I've done in the past months as a Pre-Sales Cloud/AI Architect @ the IBM Cognitive Systems Center, Montpellier.

The content will be enriched continuously, stay tuned. 
Feel free to contact me for complementary information, pptx files, live demos or questions! benoit.marolleau@fr.ibm.com

## Node-RED on IBM i 

- To get started with Node-RED, refer to http://ibmcloud-watson-day.mybluemix.net/     
- For ease of use, I wrote this Db2 for i in Node-RED :    https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-db2-for-i
- This tutorial (IBM i or other platforms) for  [Node-RED & Db2 for i with Watson](https://ibmcloud-watson-day.mybluemix.net/files/Lab.Node-RED-SocialDashboard.pdf)
- Reference docs: 
  - First of all, an excellent article for installing Node-RED on IBM i  https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/i-running-node-red/
